# Explanation for "Index.html"

The HTML file sets up the structure of the calculator web page.
It includes a container div for the calculator with two main sections: the display area (where the user input and results are shown) and the buttons area.
Buttons are provided for digits (0-9), basic operators (+, -, *, /), decimal point (.), parentheses, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions (log, ln), and complex number support (i, +, -).
It includes links to external CSS and JavaScript files for styling and functionality.

# Explanation for "style.css"

The CSS file is responsible for styling the calculator and making it visually appealing.
It defines styles for the calculator container, display area, buttons, and individual buttons' appearance.

# Explanation for "index.js"

The JavaScript file contains the logic and functionality of the calculator.
It starts by defining variables, including resultField to reference the input field where results are displayed and currentInput to store the current input expression.
Functions like appendToResult, clearResult, and calculateResult are defined to handle appending input, clearing the display, and evaluating the expression, respectively.
Functions calculateTrig, calculateLogarithm, and calculateComplex handle trigonometric calculations, logarithmic calculations, and complex number operations, respectively. They prompt the user for additional input and calculate the result based on the chosen operation.
The code ensures that invalid inputs are handled gracefully, displaying "Error" when necessary.


 # This Scientific calculator is a simplified example and can be further expanded and enhanced for more complex use cases.
